        <h1>Crowd-Pleasing Carbonara Pizza Ready in Just 30 Minutes</h1>
        This white pizza borrows all the best parts from spaghetti Carbonara with an extra dose of cheese to boot.<br>
        <img src="car.jpg" height="300" width="400">
        <p align="justify">Spaghetti Carbonara is one of those perfect foods that bring immediate comfort, and this homemade <br>
             pizza will do just that. It keeps the creaminess and saltiness of the traditional pasta classic with the added perk <br>
             of fluffy pizza dough and melty mozzarella. Crispy pancetta and sharp Pecorino adorn the pizza dough before it hits the <br>
             oven, and once the crust begins to puff and the cheese melts, eggs adorn the top (a crucial ingredient!). Adding the eggs<br>
              partway through cooking ensures the eggs don’t overcook—a runny yolk is a must on this carbonara pizza recipe.</p>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        1. 4 oz diced pancetta or chopped thick-cut bacon

        <br><br>2. 1 lb fresh pizza dough, at room temperature

        <br><br>3. All-purpose flour, for dusting

        <br><br>4. 2 cups shredded whole-milk mozzarella cheese

        <br><br>5. 1/4 cup Pecorino Romano cheese, grated, plus more for topping

        <br><br>6. 1/4 tsp ground black pepper, plus more for topping

        <br><br>7. 1 large egg

        <br><br>8. 1 large egg yolk

        <br><br>9. 1 Tbsp chopped chives, for topping
        <br><br>

        <H2>Directions</H2>
<p align=justify>Preheat oven to 450°F with a rack in lower third position. Place pancetta in a large skillet. Cook over medium,<br>
     stirring occasionally, until golden and starting to crisp, about 6 minutes. Remove from heat. Transfer pancetta to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain.</p>
<hr color="green" width="50%">
<p align=justify>Gently stretch dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured work surface. Transfer to a lightly floured baking sheet.<br> Sprinkle evenly with mozzarella and Pecorino Romano, leaving a 3/4-inch border around edges. Top with cooked pancetta and sprinkle with pepper.</p>
<hr color="green" width="50%">
<p align=justify>Bake until crust is puffed but still pale and cheese is melted, about 8 minutes. Meanwhile, place egg and yolk in a small<br> bowl or measuring cup (do not whisk).</p>
<hr color="green" width="50%">
<p align=justify>Carefully pull rack with pizza out from oven and tip eggs onto center of pizza. Using a fork, carefully spread egg white over <br>
    a larger area to help eggs cook evenly. Return to oven and bake until whites are set and yolks are runny, about 5 minutes.</p>
<hr color="green" width="50%">
<p align=justify>Break yolks with a spoon and drizzle all over pizza, if desired. Top with chives, Pecorino Romano, and several grinds of pepper.</p>
